<p>Hi, there!</p>

<p>Let me guess it: you're on this page cause you want to know more about me, right?
So here it goes.</p>

<p>My name is <a href="https://twitter.com/yevhen">Yevhen</a> and I'm an Xtremely Passionate software engineer from Kiev, Ukraine (ye, that one which in the news all the time).
I'm doing a lot of work with .NET platform and C# (F# is ok as well) building distributed systems for fun and profit. I have vast experience in building scalable business systems on .NET and I hate when people said that this platform is poor for creating such kind of systems.</p>

<p>I'm a big fan of Domain-Driven-Design, SOA (Microservices nowadays) and Hypermedia REST APIs. CQRS, Event Sourcing and NoSQL is something I spent a lot of time on.</p>

<p>But that's not really important: developing applications which solve particular business problem in a simplest possible way, is what is the most satisfying thing for me in the end. Learning ins and outs of different domains, being it Accounting, Manufacturng, Logistics or Social Networks is something I really love to do.</p>

<p>Cloud and Big Data don't scare me as after a number of successful production systems which use Windows Azure PaaS and Amazon EC2 offerings.
My current technical interests include: <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/orleans/">MSR Project Orleans</a>, <a href="http://geteventstore.com/">EventStore</a>, <a href="http://ravendb.net/">RavenDB</a>, CEP and related technologies and approaches.</p>

<p>In general, I'm just a software engineer loving his craft and aiming for excellence in it.
I'm might be biased at some things but it's just a matter of certain life experiences.
</p>

<p>I believe that thinking first is the way to go. 
As well as applying other useful techniques our industry learnt the hard way, such as: XP, TDD, CI, DevOps, etc.</p>

<p>I'm open for consulting, mentoring and short-contract work proposals. You can follow me on <a href="https://twitter.com/yevhen">twitter</a> or contact directly via <a href="mailto:yevhen.bobrov@gmail.com">email</a>.</p>
